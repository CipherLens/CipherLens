     * The number 0 must be represented with `s = +1`. Although many library
     * functions treat all-limbs-zero as equivalent to a valid representation
     * of 0 regardless of the sign bit, there are exceptions, so bignum
     * functions and external callers must always set \c s to +1 for the
     * number zero.
     *
     * Note that this implies that calloc() or `... = {0}` does not create
     * a valid MPI representation. You must call mbedtls_mpi_init().
